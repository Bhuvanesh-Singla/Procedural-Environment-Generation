# Procedural Environment Generation

We collected earth heightmap images by scraping various websites. After preprocessing and cleaning the images, we created our dataset which has been hosted on Kaggle. It can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhuvaneshsingla/procedural-environment-generation).

The link to our project report is given [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17xS5INiF-unRQuC3KZDy22f_GUC0L1R421J8lmPDmbw/edit#heading=h.ot7vjq9fno6a), where you can find a detailed account of our abstract, literature survey, methodology, results, challenges faced, and potential future work.
